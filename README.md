# policy-xposed
Policy Xposed exposes hidden privacy risks buried inside long privacy policies by automatically detecting risky clauses, highlighting them on the page, and explaining their impact in clear, human-friendly language—helping users make informed consent decisions.

# Policy Xposed:
Policy Xposed is a Chrome extension that helps users quickly spot hidden risks in privacy policies. It highlights risky terms and explains them in simple language, so you don’t have to read pages of legal text to know what you’re agreeing to.

## The Problem
Privacy policies are long, complicated, and full of legal jargon. Most people just click “Accept” without understanding what data they are sharing, how it’s used, or who it’s shared with. This leaves users vulnerable to tracking, selling of data, and other privacy risks.

## Our Solution
Policy Xposed makes it easy to understand privacy policies:

- Highlights risky terms like **tracking, selling data, analytics, third-party sharing, and location tracking**
- Shows an overall **risk level** (Low, Medium, High) for the policy
- Lets you jump straight to risky sections on the page
- Gives short, clear explanations of what each risky clause means

## Built With
- **JavaScript**  
- **Chrome Extensions (Manifest V3)**  
- **DOM Parsing** (reads the webpage structure and text to find risky words)
  
## How to Use
1. Open **Google Chrome** → go to `chrome://extensions`  
2. Enable **Developer Mode**  
3. Click **Load Unpacked** → select the `policy-xposed` folder  
4. Open any privacy policy page to see it in action
